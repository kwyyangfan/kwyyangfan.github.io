# <center> Hi!
&nbsp;
<center> Welcome to Breeze's website!
&nbsp;
<center> I am a Ph.D candidate in Computer Science at University of Liverpool, and my research interests are recommender system, user modeling and trustworthy AI. I'm striving to make recommender system more fair and explainable.
&nbsp;
<center> I am also a mother and a feminist.
&nbsp;
<center> This blog will include but not limited to my academic life, thoughts about my research, daily life experience and political expression.
